How To Calculate An EMI ?

There are two methods to calculate the monthly EMI :

- 1. ON REDUCING RATE BASIS – USING EMI CALCULATOR
  2. ON FLAT RATE BASIS – USING NORMAL CALCULATOR

Basic information we need to calculate EMI :

1. LOAN AMOUNT
2. RATE OF INTEREST
3. TENURE OF LOAN

Calculating the **EMI with Reducing Rate** \-

Download any EMI calculator application from google playstore, input the above asked information in the columns like Amount, ROI% and Loan Tenure and press calculate, you will get the Monthly EMI on Reducing Rate Basis

Calculating the **EMI with Flat Rate** \-

**LOAN INTEREST** \= LOAN AMOUNT **x** ROI% **x** TIME IN YEARS

**TOTAL REPAYMENT TO BE DONE** \= LOAN AMOUNT + LOAN INTEREST

**MONTHLY EMI** \= TOTAL REPAYMENT DIVIDED BY TENURE OF LOAN (IN MONTHS)
